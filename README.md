# Hands-Talk

## What is Hands Talk?

**Problem:** In a world where clear communication is essential, speech-impaired individuals who rely on sign language face challenges in understanding lessons, participating in discussions, and communicating in various settings, from schools to workplaces.

**Solution:** Introducing Hands Talk, an innovative browser extension app powered by artificial intelligence. It seamlessly interprets sign language using your webcam, displaying text on your screen like subtitles or reading it aloud through your microphone.

**Description of Solution:** Our solution comprises three essential components:

**Front End:** This browser extension serves as the user interface, seamlessly integrating into your web browser. It automatically detects when you join a meeting and offers assistance with sign language interpretation.

**Back End:** Responsible for receiving webcam frames. This component feeds them to our AI model for processing and translation. Once processed, the translated text is sent back to your screen for easy comprehension.

**AI Model:** The AI model is at the heart of our solution. It accurately detects users' hand gestures and translates them into text, ensuring precise communication. This model has been meticulously trained using Python and a variety of specialized packages such as Pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. These tools enable us to achieve optimal performance and accuracy in recognizing and interpreting hand gestures.

With these components working seamlessly together, Hands Talk empowers speech-impaired individuals, making online meetings and conversations accessible to all.
