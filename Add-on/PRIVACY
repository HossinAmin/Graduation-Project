"Mercator Studio for Google Meet" is a browser extension which injects a 
JavaScript program into Google Meet. This program applies color filters and 
draws shapes on your video feed. It runs entirely inside the browser, accessing 
no external resources. It remembers your input preferences by putting them in 
your browser's local storage. These preferences can be deleted by clearing your
browser's site data. Only your filtered video data is transmitted to Google
Meet. However, Google handles your filtered video data according to their own
Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can stop the  transmission of video
data to both the extension and Google Meet by turning off the camera, for
example, through the Google Meet's "disable camera" button.
