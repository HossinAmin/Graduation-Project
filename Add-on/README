Mercator Studio gives you fine control over your appearance on Google Meet.

Precisely adjust lighting and colors:
· Exposure & Contrast
· Temperature & Tint
· Hue & Saturation
· Sepia & Blur
· Fade & Vignette

Move the focus to where you want it:
· Rotate, Scale, Mirror & Flip
· Horizontal & Vertical Translate
· Pillarbox & Letterbox Crop

Write text & emoji in front of your face:
· Auto-adjusts size to fit any length of text onto the screen.
· Auto-converts \sqrt to √, \times to ×, \cdot to ·, \pm to ±, ^number to ¹², and _number to ₄₂.

Somewhat nice presets:
· Concorde
· Mono
· Matcha
· Deepfry

Scroll, drag, or use arrow keys on the sliders to adjust; Right click or press 0 on them to reset; And hold down Ctrl or Shift for finer steps.

Ctrl + M to open/close the interface. Ctrl + Shift + M to minimize it.

Translated for português, español, italiano, français, & 中文.

This project is no longer in active development. As the pandemic subsides in my area, so has my use of Google Meet, and with it Mercator Studio. At the same time, I think its development has reached a calm plateau.

My fingers are crossed that Mercator will continue working for those still learning or working from home, but I will no longer add new features or patch minor bugs. Though, if there are any changes to Google Meet that breaks the core functionality of Mercator Studio, I will strive to get them fixed.

Until then, thank you for all of your support. I know this year must have been awful for a lot of you. I hope my extension helped alleviate some of your camera anxieties, or caused some laughter as you turned your skin blue.

Best regards,
